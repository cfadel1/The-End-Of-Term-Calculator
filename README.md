# The-End-Of-Term-Calculator

This calculator is a Windows Application created using C#. The caclculator can calculate a student's current average, this includes calculating and adding the averages of his assignements, quizzes, labs, midterms and any extra bonus given to him. Towards the end of the term he can input what average he is hoping to receive and the calculator will tell him what grade he should aim for. Also, he can input what grade he thinks he got on the exam and the calculator will calculate his overall average for the course.

## How to run

You can open the executable file found in `WindowsFormsApplication1\bin\Debug`
You can also open the solution in visual studio, and have fun with it. 

## Result

This is one of the first few Windows Applications I created and to be honest if I had a chance to redo it I would change the whole UI and use WPF.
